Tokenization involves splitting the sentence into individual words or tokens.\n","\n","**Lemmatization:** For each token, it retrieves its lemma (base form) using SpaCy's lemmatization feature.

This standardizes the text and ensures that words with the same meaning but different cases are treated identically.\n","\n","**Stopwords and Punctuation Removal:** It removes stopwords and punctuation tokens from the list of tokens. Stopwords are common words that often don't carry significant meaning in the context of natural language processing tasks, such as \"and,\" \"the,\" \"is,\" etc. Punctuation marks are also removed since they generally don't add semantic value to the text.\n","\n","**Returning Preprocessed Tokens:** Finally, it returns the preprocessed list of tokens, which contains lemmatized, lowercase tokens with stopwords and punctuation removed."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"f1051e45","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-06T17:16:21.954779Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-06T17:16:21.954229Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-06T17:16:21.961505Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-06T17:16:21.960403Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.022936,"end_time":"2024-02-06T17:16:21.963934","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-06T17:16:21.940998","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Creating our tokenizer function\n","def spacy_tokenizer(sentence):\n","    # Creating our token object, which is used to create documents with linguistic annotations.\n","    doc = nlp(sentence)\n","\n","    #print(doc)\n","    #print(type(doc))\n","\n","    # Lemmatizing each token and converting each token into lowercase\n","    mytokens = [ word.lemma_.lower().strip() for word in doc ]\n","\n","    #print(mytokens)\n","\n","    # Removing stop words\n","    mytokens = [ word for word in mytokens if word not in stop_words and word not in punctuations ]\n","\n","    # return preprocessed list of tokens\n","    return mytokens"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"id":"0c1dbc57","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-06T17:16:21.987094Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-06T17:16:21.986691Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-06T17:16:22.022426Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-06T17:16:22.021096Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.050845,"end_time":"2024-02-06T17:16:22.02575","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-06T17:16:21.974905","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["['eat', 'apple']"]},"execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["sentence=\"I am eating Apple\"\n","spacy_tokenizer(sentence)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8bc4f07c","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.011816,"end_time":"2024-02-06T17:16:22.048896","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-06T17:16:22.03708","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["> By setting the tokenizer parameter to spacy_tokenizer, the CountVectorizer will use the specified custom tokenizer function to preprocess the text data before converting it into a matrix of token counts.
